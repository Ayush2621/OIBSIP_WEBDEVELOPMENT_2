A Simple Student Portfolio 
These project includes Html,css,js . 
I have made a simple and a perfect portfolio for students .
in these i have added nav bar which on click redirects to the specific section selected like Certificate , profects , education etc.
in these i have also added the social media link on click which will actually redirects to the handle page . 
i have added the hover function for buttons and specific view for certificate section . and a footer which refers to the policy and creator . 
there is also a profile pic of the student or a person to whome  the portfolio belongs.
