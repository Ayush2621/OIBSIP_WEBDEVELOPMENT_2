    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Ayush Raj, a passionate and detail-oriented Computer Science undergraduate with a strong interest in full-stack web development, app development, and tech innovation. I enjoy building intuitive, responsive, and functional digital experiences that solve real-world problems.

Over the past year, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in frontend development, backend integration, and project deployment by working on personal and freelance projects, including a fully-functional e-commerce platform named Levoe, and a gamified educational website called Justice Junction. Iâ€™ve also contributed to the Uttaranchal University E-sports Club as a content creator and worked as a Business Management Intern at Younity.

In 2024, I was proud to rank 5th in IIT Bombayâ€™s Eureka Hackathon, where I collaborated on building impactful digital solutions under pressure.

I believe in continuous learning and am always exploring new technologies, tools, and frameworks. Currently, I'm honing my backend development skills and diving deeper into cloud deployment, Firebase, MongoDB, and Razorpay integrations. I'm also working on launching my faceless tech YouTube channel â€“ Tech Walt, focused on honest reviews and tutorials.</p><br>
<h2>ðŸŽ¯ Goals</h2>
<p>My long-term goal is to work at Google or a top tech company, where I can contribute to impactful projects, collaborate with brilliant minds, and grow as a software engineer. Iâ€™m also driven by a desire to create educational platforms and tools that make tech learning more accessible and fun.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio â€” Iâ€™m excited about whatâ€™s next, and Iâ€™d love to connect!</p>
